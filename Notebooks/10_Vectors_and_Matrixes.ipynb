    "# Vectors and Matrixes with Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook we will dig a little deeper into the Numpy library to specifically highlight how you can work with _vectors_ and _matrixes_ using Numpy. Those of you that are familiar with MatLab may find that Numpy is a little more clumsy and sometimes a bit confusing. This is one of the costs of using a general programming language, compared to the dedicated linear algebra application that is MatLab. I hope that with a little attention you can get comfortable with Numpy _vectors_ and _matrixes_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Numpy is now heavily used by _data scientists_, and that an ever increasing number of packages are build on top of Numpy. In that sense, the underlying math has been increadibly well tested and is very reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "There is actually no object in Numpy (or Python) that is designated as a _vector_, and there are only a few specific widely used packages that I know of that implement a physics 3-vector (one of them is visual python, or vpython), although you can find many examples of people that wrote their own. This may be an oversight, or perhaps it reflects the idea that the general _array_ object of Numpy does what is needed, and it is difficult to actually do better. The alternative is to use one of the C++ 3- and 4-vector libraries that have a Python interface (ROOT, GEANT4, CLHEP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector = np.array\n",
    "\n",
    "So the basic vector-like object in Python was already introduced in the [Intro to Numpy](https://github.com/mholtrop/Phys601/blob/master/Notebooks/02_Intro_Numpy.ipynb) notebook. Here we will investigate the properties of the `np.array`, and the related `np.matrix` a bit further, so we can use this knowledge later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most respects, the `np.array` object behaves as you would expect from a _mathematical vector_, while the Python `list` object definitely does not. A simple example shows you how different they are:"

(Note that in neither case there is complex conjugation!) There is also the function [`np.inner`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.inner.html), which for a 1-D array gives the same as a dot product. For 2-D (conventional matrixes) and higher, these two behave differently: np.dot is the sum product over the last axis with the one but last axis, while np.inner is the sum product over the last axis.\n",
