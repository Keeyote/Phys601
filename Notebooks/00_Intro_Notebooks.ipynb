    "# Intro for Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook, sometimes also called a Python Notebook, is a great way to create reports or documents where you mix bits of code with documenting text explainging the code. A Jupyter Notebook is easy to start up from the Anaconda Navigator (just click on Jupyter Notebook), or from the command line with \"jupyter-notebook\" or \"jupyter notebook\".\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here is a good intro to Notebooks.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find detailed online documentation on the Jupyter Notebook on line: [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have a computer that is capable of running notebooks, or you choose not to install the required software, you can run notebooks at Microsoft Azure for free. Go to [notebooks.azure.com](https://notebooks.azure.com) and click in sign-in, then use your UNH email address and on the next page sign in with your UNH credentials.\n",
    "You can upload the notebooks from GitHub (also owned by Microsoft) directly into the Azure notebooks ([see this blog post](https://medium.com/@dadbrains/integrating-azure-notebooks-jupyter-notebooks-with-github-fd847e941e4))"

    "The notebook interface shows up in your browser. You start with a \"home\" tab, where you can see all the files in the directory where the notebook was started: either your Documents directory, or the directory where you typed the command to start the notebook. From there you can navigate to other directories and upon up a notebook by clicking on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About cells.\n",
    "The notebook consists of cells. Each cell is either \"Markdown\", which is a way of writing formatted text, or it is \"code\", which is for Python code. You render the text, or execute the code, by typeping shift-enter. When you do that, the Markdown will get typeset, and the Python code will be executed. Below each code cell you will get the output produced by that bit of code. Each code cell will acumulate, as if they were part of a single Python program.\n",

You can explore these on your own, or go to the full [Jupyter Notebook Documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)"

    "To learn more about the documenting text cells, read the [Markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), or [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or the [Jupyter notebook specific section](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html?highlight=Latex)\n",

    "What is very nice for scientists, is that the text cells also allow formulas to be entered using LaTex. You enclose an inline latex formula with \\$ symbols, and a display formula (on a line of its own) with \\$\\$ symbols.\n",

So not the \"File\" menu from the browser!! If you plan to submit the results, it is probably best to select \"PDF via Latex\". You should get a nicely formatted document in your downloads folder, which can then be printed, if need be."

To interrupt this process, you can click on the square box in the menu bar, or choose \"Interrupt\" from the kernel dropdown menu. The kernel dropdown menu also allows you to restart the kernel. When you do that, all previous calculations are forgotten and you get a clean slate. This can be useful if you made a mistake that got Python in a confusing state. Just reset, and then re-evaluate your cells."
