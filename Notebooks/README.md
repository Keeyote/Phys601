# Notebooks for Phys601

These notebooks, and supporting data, are used in the UNH Phys601 course.

## Content:

0. **00\_python\_tutorial\_1** and  **00\_python\_tutorial\_2** - These are good tutorial to start learning, or brushing up, on your Python skills.
1. **01\_Intro\_Notebooks**, **02\_Intro\_Numpy**, and **03\_Intro\_Plotting** - These are notebooks that from an important basis. They are a starting point.
2. **04\_Basic\_Calculus** - Shows how to integrate or differentiate a function, or a set of data points. Show how to use spline interpolation.
2. **05\_Random\_Numbers** - Introduction to random numbers, random distributions, the mean and standard deviation and histograms. Show how to make a random distribution of any shape.
3. **06\_Errors\_and\_Bugs** - Introduction on how to track down errors in your code, and how to debug code.
4. **07\_Stepping\_in\_Time** - Show how to step a differential equation, using a thrown ball as an example. Shows how to program a Runge-Kutta algorithm.
5. **08\_Very\_Large\_Numbers** - Shows how to work with numbers that are very large, either integers, or floating point.

### Advanced Notebooks:

1. **A01\_Ordinary\_Differential\_Equations** goes beyond "Stepping in Time" to look at how you can solve ODEs. The **A02\_Double\_Pendulum** shows how to use this to solve, and display, the double pendulum.
2. **A03\_Advanced\_Least\_Square\_Fitting** - Shows how to fit complicated data to a complicated function with multiple parameters.

### Extra Notebooks:

1. **E1\_Zebra\_Puzzle** - A notebook that guides you through solving "Einstein's Puzzle", or the "Zebra Puzzle". You need to program the solution yourself.
