# Phys601
Code and Notebooks for Physics 601 at the University of New Hampshire

## Notebooks

All the Jypyter notebooks are in the Notebooks subdirectory.

Notebook names start with a number, so they are sequenced in the order in which they were discussed in class. Notebooks starting with an "E" are extras, just for entertainment, but you can learn a lot from them. Notebooks starting with "A" are considered more advanced. 

## Special Relativity

Here are some notebooks and code that are specific for the topic of Special Relativity, 
as it taught in Physics 505 at UNH.

## QM Notebooks

This is the location for a set of more advanced notebooks specifically
for Quantum Mechanics.

## Advanced

Here you find more advanced notebooks and code, which assume a higher level of 
familiarity with Python and the basic set of notebooks, which is
why they will have less detailed explanations of each step
in a calculation.
