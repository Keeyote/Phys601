## Notebooks

All the Jypyter notebooks are in the Notebooks subdirectory.

Notebook names start with a number, so they are sequenced in the order in which they were discussed in class. Notebooks starting with an "E" are extras, just for entertainment, but you can learn a lot from them. Notebooks starting with "A" are considered more advanced.
