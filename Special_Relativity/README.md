# Special Relativity Codes

Some simple Python tools to help with Special Relativity problems.

* MinkowskiPlot.py - This is the file that contains the classes 
to make the Minkowsi Space-Time plot with a slider for the boost,
which is used in other notebooks.
* Spiff_Shoots_Pellet - A notebook that illustrates the Minkowski Space-Time 
diagram and illustrates the problem of Spaceman Spiff shooting a railgun 
pellet to the front of their spaceship.
